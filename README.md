# Python-SE

Task:

To implement a function that can calculate the lowest common ancestor in a graph, that may be structured as a binary tree.
Then add unit test code to each repository that tests the implementation.

My implementation:

The main lca function has come from a resource online. Unit testing was added to this to match the lca function. For part 2 of the lca task we have to enhance our previous lca solution, implementing as a branch that we must merge with our master branch. It should work for graphs structured in directed acyclic form and this has been completed.
